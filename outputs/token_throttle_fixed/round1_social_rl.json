The cost of living, especially for young professionals like myself, is a significant concern. I've been following the policies proposed by different parties and have some thoughts on what could really make a difference. **Concept A:** This proposal focuses on increasing the supply of affordable housing through direct government intervention, such as building more social housing units and providing grants to developers to build more rental units. **Concept B:** This concept emphasizes market-based solutions, such as tax incentives for homeowners to rent out spare rooms or short-term rentals, and promoting private investment in the housing market. ### My Reflection **[REFLECT]** Both concepts aim to address the housing crisis, but they approach it from different angles.",
