I appreciate your sentiment about finding common ground. It seems like a lot of people are talking past each other these days.\n\nOne issue that comes to mind is affordable housing. This affects both urban and suburban areas, and it's something that people across the political spectrum can agree is important. What do you think about that?\n\nAlso, how do you see us bridging the gap between different viewpoints in a constructive way?",

I agree with both of you that finding common ground is crucial. I often feel like my voice isn\u2019t heard, especially when discussions focus too much on urban issues.\n\nAffordable housing is definitely a concern, but it might look different in rural areas. For instance, the cost of maintaining infrastructure and services in sparsely populated regions can be challenging. That said, it\u2019s still an issue that affects people regardless of where they live.\n\nAnother issue that comes to mind is healthcare. In rural areas, access to healthcare facilities can be limited, which affects everyone, whether they\u2019re young or old. Improving healthcare access and quality could be a unifying goal.\n\nHow do you think we can bridge the gap between urban and rural perspectives? And what steps can we take to ensure that all voices are heard equally in political discussions?",
