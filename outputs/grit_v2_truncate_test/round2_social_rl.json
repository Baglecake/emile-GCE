While it might seem like a good idea to ensure everyone participates in the democratic process, I think it's important for individuals to engage with politics and make informed decisions about their future. Forcing someone to vote doesn't necessarily mean they'll be well-informed or invested in the outcome.\n\nPolitics matters a great deal for people like me because we face significant economic pressures. Living in an urban area, I see firsthand how policies can impact housing costs, access to healthcare, and job security. As someone who leans NDP and reliably votes in elections, I feel that my voice needs to be heard on these issues. Parties need to address the concerns of young professionals and families, but often, they don't reach out to voters like me effectively enough.\n\nWhen it comes to political engagement, I find myself quite involved, but sometimes I feel that my contributions aren't always acknowledged. This can be discouraging, especially when it seems like certain voices dominate the discourse. It\u2019s crucial for parties to listen to diverse perspectives and recognize the efforts of engaged citizens like myself. \n\nIn summary, while voting isn't mandatory for me, I strongly believe it's a responsibility that should be taken seriously. Politics directly affects our lives, and it's important for parties to reach out and truly represent the needs and desires of all voters, including those of us who are actively participating in the system.",
