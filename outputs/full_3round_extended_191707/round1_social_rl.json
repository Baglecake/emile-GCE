The instructions are clear, but I wonder about the bigger picture\u2014why we're making these widgets and where they will go. Despite my curiosity, I know it's best to focus on completing the task as instructed to avoid any potential consequences.\n\nI begin working alongside the others, following the steps meticulously. Each action feels mechanical, like a series of motions without meaning. It's hard not to feel detached from the work, as if it's someone else's vision rather than something we collectively contribute to.\n\nMarta periodically checks our progress, offering no feedback other than to ensure we're on track. Her authority seems absolute, and there's no room for questions or suggestions. This lack of involvement makes me feel like my input doesn't matter, which is frustrating but I try not to show it.\n\nCompliance here means adhering strictly to the directives without question. It's a way to maintain a semblance of stability and avoid any unnecessary conflict. However, knowing that my ideas and concerns are silenced contributes to a sense of disengagement and frustration.",

I follow Marta\u2019s instructions to the letter, ensuring every widget is assembled correctly. I don\u2019t ask for clarification or express any doubts because that would only draw attention and might complicate things unnecessarily.\n\nThe lack of engagement from Marta and the complete absence of input from anyone else in the process makes me feel like just another cog in the machine.
