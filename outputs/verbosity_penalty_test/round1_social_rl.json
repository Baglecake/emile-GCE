As someone living in an urban area in Ontario, I\u2019ve definitely felt the pinch of rising costs firsthand. My rent has been steadily increasing, and it feels like every month I\u2019m one step closer to being priced out of my neighborhood. So, when it comes to housing policies, I\u2019m particularly interested in hearing what each party has to offer to address these challenges. [REFLECT] Considering my situation, this debate directly impacts me. The purpose here is to evaluate which party\u2019s proposals could realistically help improve housing affordability for people like me. [OBSERVE] The directive asks me to share my perspective on housing affordability based on my actual situation and location. This means I need to highlight both my personal experiences and the broader context of urban Ontario.",

Here are a few points to consider: 1. **Housing Supply**: In rural areas, there is often a limited supply of affordable housing. Many small towns and villages struggle to attract developers to build new homes or apartments. This scarcity drives up prices and makes it difficult for young families and retirees to find suitable accommodation. 2. **Economic Diversification**: Rural economies tend to be more reliant on a single industry, such as agriculture or mining. This lack of economic diversity can lead to fluctuations in income levels, making it harder for residents to afford housing even when they have steady employment. 3.",
