If you have any questions about the process or if something is unclear, feel free to ask for clarification. However, any requests for changes or modifications will not be entertained. We need to maintain a high level of efficiency and consistency in our production.\n\nLet's begin with the first cycle. Alice, you will handle the assembly line, ensuring that all components are correctly placed and assembled according to the specifications I provide. Ben, you will oversee the quality control, making sure each widget meets our standards before it leaves the factory floor.

I expect full compliance and a focus on efficiency. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n**[Reflection]**: By clearly defining roles and expectations, I am establishing a framework where workers understand their responsibilities and the boundaries of their autonomy.
