As a 25-34 year old woman from Ontario, living in an urban area, I'm deeply concerned about the rising costs of housing and the policies that could address these challenges. Here\u2019s how I see it: ### My Current Situation I live in a bustling urban neighborhood in Toronto, where the cost of living is already quite high. I rent a modest apartment and work in the tech industry, which has its perks but also means long hours and a significant portion of my income going towards rent and other expenses. The idea of buying a home feels out of reach for now, and even if it wasn't, the mortgage payments would be a strain. ### Concept A: Rent Control and Tenant Protections One of the key concepts discussed here is rent control and tenant protections.",
