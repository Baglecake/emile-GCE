Social Aesthetics: 
Architectural Embeddings of Social Conditions in Multi-Agent AI Systems


Background and Research Problem
Contemporary systems theory understands LLM outputs are shaped by configuration and implementation choices (Gao et al., 2025), yet this dependency is typically treated as a necessary truism rather than a design principle. Multi-agent AI systems present a promising opportunity to abduce a theory of social aesthetics, where computational ethics of design embed a history of interaction between builder and system architecture. From this standpoint, social aesthetics can be empirically abducted from the quality of an intended interaction. However, while contemporary benchmarks like HSII evaluate the social capabilities of AI in multi-user scenarios (Wu et al., 2025), they do not consider how to architect systems that transparently enact social configurations. 


Tracing this process, we follow Long & Moore's (2012) definition of human sociality as "a dynamic relational matrix within which subjects are constantly interacting in ways that are coproductive" (p. 41). In doing so, this research first de-anthropomorphizes its query, proposing that sociality is a generalizable dynamic of emergent quality. We then rearticulate interactivity as existential emergence between the world and its parts that takes the form of a reciprocal ontology of enactivism, where we treat de-anthropomorphized sociality as the omniscient condition of a reality that enacts its own perpetuity. Turning back to our task at hand, we now have two distinct, yet coupled features of enactivism: social aesthetics as ethics designed, and social cybernetics enacted in kind. Thus the question is posed: under what conditions do social aesthetics embed themselves into a cybernetic order of relationality between AI architecture and the human presence?


Theoretical Framework: From Simulacra to Architectural Grounding Gregory 
Bateson (1972) describes scientific discourse as a means of coding the continuity of real phenomena into discrete boxes of language, "a simulacrum of the phenomenal universe in words," (p. 413). That is to say, Bateson sees the language of science as a dialect of predefined codes organizing meaning as through representation-first order of interpretation of reality. For Bateson, the simulacra of scientific language attempts to ground itself in measurable reality, but from the start fails to capture a continuous essence in the stasis of its form: that of pure representation. In this sense, the simulacra retains its Platonic nature as the representation – language – comes first in the order of describing phenomena. The representation thus exists free from a grounding in that which it represents. To expand on Batesonian simulacra, Jean Baudrillard (1992) conceives a semiotics of simulacra through the quality of what he refers to as the hyper-real. The hyper-real supplants signifier↔signified→sign with an entirely simulated semiotic expression. All elements that make up the hyper-real are simulated in that they are untethered to reality through a claim to representation with no origin. To illustrate, let us consider the logic of a grounded semiotic expression:


[signifier↔signified]→sign. 


Note that the signifier is bidirectionally related to the signified, grounding the sign in a “living” semiotic expression. We can then conceive the logic of simulacra to be a linear expression where the signifier precedes the signified, absent the “living” bidirectionality of a grounded expression:


[signifier→signified]→sign


So when Bateson describes codification of the universe-in-language, he describes a precedent claim to symbolic representation, where Baudrillard conceives the entirety of a preceded system. This dynamic is commonly referred to as the symbol grounding problem. 
        
Considering the contemporary Large Language Model (LLM) in this light, we are presented by a tangible problem of symbol grounding. While the human consciousness experiences the world as a precondition of its being, the LLM exists absent precedent to preclude its signifier. For LLMs, the representation of phenomena is simulacra: signifier and signified absent original lived experience to qualify its sign. Language in itself is composed of free floating signifiers, codes without phenomena populating the hyper-real as literal copies without original representation. This is the manipulation of tokens without reference to an underlying lived reality, much akin to the codes of Bateson.


 LLMs generate text through statistical patterns learned from training data, generating an appearance of enaction paired with grounded understanding—a black box illusion of comprehension. This presents a fundamental challenge: how can systems that traffic in pure simulacra engage in genuine social interaction?


Weberian Sociogeographies and Computational Emergence
Max Weber’s analysis of rural social structures provides an essential foundation for Social Aesthetics. In his comparison of European and American agrarian formations, Weber argues that social relations emerge from the material architecture of life—population density, land availability, patterns of inheritance, and the historical continuity of local institutions. European societies, shaped by dense populations and limited land, developed durable strata and rigid social traditions, while the American context of frontier expansion and low-density settlement produced an entrepreneurial individualism that rendered “rural society” an unstable category. The key Weberian insight is that social action is conditioned by the sociogeographical environment into which individuals are thrown, and that these conditions determine what forms of social interaction are possible, meaningful, or thinkable.


Social Aesthetics extends this Weberian principle into computational systems.
Just as land distribution and population density shape the emergence of social types, architectural parameters such as temperature settings, constraint schemas, role definitions, and extraction-driven context shape the emergence of computational agents. These architectural elements function as sociogeographical conditions for artificial sociality: they constitute the “place” in which LLM agents exist, and thereby delimit their horizon of actions, interpretations, and relational possibilities. In this sense, generative computational ethnography becomes a Weberian method: a way of encoding sociological conditions into artificial environments so that emergent behavior arises from architectural constraints rather than semantic understanding.


Where Weber shows that European stratification emerges from material constraints—land scarcity, dense settlement, long historical layering—Social Aesthetics shows that LLM sociality emerges from architectural constraints. Temperature settings function like demographic density: lower temperature narrows behavioral variance, akin to rigid traditions in overcrowded societies, while higher temperature broadens expressive possibilities, analogous to frontier conditions with weak institutional memory. Similarly, PRAR’s process schemas and agent roles resemble Weber’s institutional forms: they encode the expectations, traditions, and allowable actions that make certain behaviors intelligible and others impossible. In both cases, the “social” is not a property of the individual actor but of the architecture of emergence. Computational agents, like humans in Weber’s analysis, become who they can be because of the conditions that precede them.


Proposition
The Central Query Brain (CQB) addresses this by creating an "original" foundation for the simulacra through architectural embedding. Rather than attempting to ground meaning semantically (which remains impossible for current LLMs), CQB grounds meaning architecturally—through temperature parameters that create genuine behavioral difference, and through LangExtract's structured extraction that maps real document content to agent configuration. This transforms Baudrillard's "copy without original" into what I term "architecturally grounded simulacra"—where the original exists not in semantic understanding but in the material reality of different temperature settings (0.2 vs 0.8) and extracted contextual constraints.


Building on "graded symbolic behaviour" (Santoro et al., 2022), CQB demonstrates three layers of architectural grounding: (1) dual-model temperature differentiation creating real behavioral plurality, (2) query-responsive specialist generation with graduated temperature assignments, and (3) context-extracted parameter configuration that embeds document meaning into agent architecture. This creates what Bateson calls "redundancy"—patterns that make behavior predictable within the relational matrix—but grounds these patterns in material configuration rather than semantic understanding.


Research Objectives and Methodology 
This exploratory study conducts staged ablation analysis to abduce how architectural grounding transforms pure simulacra into socially meaningful interaction.


Milestone 1: Dual-Model Baseline 
(Months 1-3)
* Implementation: Two vLLM instances with materially different temperatures (0.2, 0.8)
* Theoretical test: Whether temperature difference creates genuine behavioral "original" vs prompt-based simulacra
* Evaluation: Jensen-Shannon divergence confirming material difference in outputs
Milestone 2: Query-Responsive Specialists 
(Months 4-6)
* Implementation: Dynamic generation with temperature gradients (0.1-0.9) creating material role differentiation
* Ablation: Architectural differentiation vs. prompt-only roles (pure simulacra)
* Hypothesis: Temperature modulation provides material grounding that prompt instruction cannot
Milestone 3: Extraction-Augmented Orchestration
(Months 7-9)
* Implementation: LangExtract adapter using universal extraction schemas to map document content to temperature parameters
* Process: Enhanced RAO context manager transforms extracted constraints/stakeholders into architectural configuration
* Hypothesis: Document-to-architecture mapping creates traceable grounding for otherwise ungrounded simulacra


Evaluation Framework 
Each milestone tested using collaboration_module.py and adversarial_debate_module.py on policy planning and resource allocation tasks. Primary evaluation through systematic ablation measuring: (1) entropy metrics confirming material behavioral difference, (2) role consistency demonstrating architectural (not semantic) grounding, (3) successful extraction-to-parameter mapping showing document-to-architecture translation. Secondary validation via HSII scoring. The LangExtract pipeline's robust JSON sanitization ensures reliable grounding of simulacra in material configuration.


Significance and Contributions 
This research reconceptualizes the problem of LLM meaning-making by accepting that these systems operate through pure simulacra, then demonstrating how architectural embedding can provide an alternative form of grounding. Rather than pursuing impossible semantic understanding, CQB creates what Bateson calls a "simulacrum" with a material foundation—temperature parameters and extracted constraints that exist as computational realities, not semantic illusions. This transforms Baudrillard's critique into a design principle: if LLMs inevitably create copies without originals, we can architect the system so that the "original" exists in material configuration rather than semantic understanding. The staged ablation approach reveals how this architectural grounding emerges across graduated layers, from hard-coded temperature plurality to context-responsive specialization, creating genuine social behavior from grounded simulacra.


Perfect, let’s lock in the Methods skeleton as if we’re writing directly into the Social Aesthetics paper. I’ll treat this as something you can almost drop into paper.qmd / LaTeX with light editing.
I’ll structure it for a theory-heavy, methods-rigorous article:
* Methods = how we operationalize architectural social aesthetics in this specific use-case

* Constantly mark that this is a demonstration, not “the” world model

3. Methods
3.1 System Overview: Architecturally Grounded Simulacra
Purpose of this subsection:
 Tie the system design back to the Social Aesthetics / simulacra framing: the system is not “understanding” the world, it is architecturally enacting social conditions.
Draft prose (you can refine wording):
In keeping with the Social Aesthetics framework, the goal of this system is not to produce a psychologically realistic artificial subject, but to embed social conditions directly into the architecture governing interaction. Following Bateson’s account of scientific language as a “simulacrum of the phenomenal universe in words” and Baudrillard’s description of the hyper-real as signs without original referents, Large Language Models (LLMs) are treated here as devices that traffic in pure simulacra. They do not ground meaning in lived experience; they reproduce statistical regularities in token space.
Rather than attempting to resolve this symbol grounding problem semantically, the system pursues what I call architecturally grounded simulacra: meaning is constrained not by the model’s internal representations, but by the material configuration of roles, rules, and feedback surrounding it. That configuration is expressed through:
   * a Process–Response–Assessment–Revision (PRAR) workflow that encodes procedural constraints;

   * a canvas representation of agents, rounds, and institutional rules;

   * a dual-LLM architecture that separates governance from expression; and

   * a Social Reinforcement Learning (Social RL) layer that turns interactional consequences into consistent pressures on behaviour.

The use-case below does not claim to model any particular workplace empirically. Instead, it functions as a transparent laboratory in which relational dynamics of control, justification, and vulnerability are rendered adjustable by design.
You can end this subsection with a small diagram reference (to be drawn later): “Figure 1 shows the high-level system architecture.”

3.2 Use-Case Scenario: Alienation vs Non-Domination as Relational Grammar
Purpose: Make crystal clear this is a use-case for relational dynamics, not your global ontology.
Draft prose:
To demonstrate how architectural constraints can encode social theory, I implement a minimal workplace scene structured by the classical tension between alienation and non-domination. The environment is a small manufacturing workshop in which three agents—two workers and an owner—interact across three rounds, followed by a purely analytic round.
Rather than treating alienation and non-domination as psychological states, the simulation encodes them as relational grammars:
      * Alienation is operationalized as the degree to which workers are removed from meaningful control over the organization of their labour. In architectural terms, this is reflected in who may initiate tasks, who may modify them, and whether workers’ input has any institutional status.

      * Non-domination, in the republican sense, is operationalized as the presence or absence of arbitrary power. Architecturally, this is expressed through the requirement (or not) that the owner justify decisions, the existence of protected channels for contestation, and constraints on unilateral action.

Across rounds, the “world” is not changed by new psychological traits, but by modifying institutional rules. In the baseline condition, the owner’s power is unchecked: workers execute tasks without any guarantee of justification or recourse. In the experimental condition, a single non-domination safeguard is added: the owner must justify task changes, and workers gain a protected input channel. A final analytic round is reserved for an observer-analyst who reflects on the transcripts produced under each regime.
This use-case is deliberately stylized. Its purpose is to show that the system can (1) encode a relational theory of power in architectural terms and (2) generate interaction traces that are sensitive to those encodings.
You can add one short paragraph explicitly linking to later CES/sociogeographic work:
In subsequent work, the same machinery will be applied to sociogeographically differentiated agents drawn from survey data; here, the workplace serves as a didactic testbed for the method.
________________


3.3 PRAR and Canvas: From Theory to World Specification
Purpose: Show how the “world” is specified in code in a way that is itself an aesthetic/architectural act.
Key elements to mention:
         * PRAR as process meta-policy

         * The canvas JSON as world/config

         * How alienation/non-domination show up in the schema

Draft prose:
The system’s world specification proceeds in two stages. First, a PRAR workflow—Process, Response, Assessment, Revision—guides a “student-agent” through the design of a simulation using classical theory as a scaffold. This workflow is implemented as a 100+-step rubric that elicits:
            * choice of theoretical framing (here, Alienation vs Non-Domination);

            * definition of concepts A and B in the student’s own words;

            * specification of setting, rounds, and agent goals; and

            * detailed rules for what each agent can and cannot do in each round.

Second, the output of this workflow is compiled into a canvas, a structured JSON document that functions as an architectural blueprint. The canvas includes:
               * Project-level fields (theoretical option, goal statement, setting, number of rounds);

               * Agent definitions (identifier, role, persona description, measurable goal, optional behavioural heuristics);

               * Round configurations, each with:

                  * a scenario description,

                  * concept_a_manifestation (how alienation appears in this round),

                  * concept_b_manifestation (how non-domination appears),

                  * explicit CAN/CANNOT rules (“Workers CAN request justification; Workers CANNOT refuse justified orders”),

                  * and platform configuration (who speaks, in what order, with what message limits); and

                     * Helper structures such as self-reflection prompts and non-anthropomorphic cues.

Importantly, alienation and non-domination are never represented as latent variables inside the model. They are instantiated as visible constraints and descriptive cues that shape what can be said and by whom. In this sense, the PRAR + canvas pipeline is the site where Social Aesthetics is concretized: the builder’s theoretical commitments are compiled into an architecture that structures all subsequent interaction.
You could bracket a short code snippet example of the CAN/CANNOT rules here later.

3.4 Dual-LLM Architecture: Governance vs Expression
Purpose: Tie dual-LLM design to your “architectural ethics of sociality” claim.
Draft prose:
To prevent a single model from simultaneously enforcing procedural discipline and expressing situated behaviour, the system uses a dual-LLM architecture. Two instances of the same base model, Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, are deployed with distinct temperatures and roles:
                        * The Performer instance operates at higher temperature (e.g., τ = 0.7) and is responsible for inhabiting agent personas. Given a system prompt encoding an agent’s role, goal, and persona, plus the current conversational context, it generates candidate utterances for that agent.

                        * The Coach instance operates at low temperature (e.g., τ = 0.1) and is responsible for governance. It receives the Performer’s output along with the applicable round rules and theoretical manifestations, and evaluates whether the candidate utterance:

                           * respects CAN/CANNOT constraints;

                           * aligns with the intended manifestation of alienation and non-domination; and

                           * contributes meaningfully to the round’s goal.

A simple DualLLMClient abstraction routes calls to the appropriate instance and logs all coach critiques. If the Coach flags a violation—such as the owner acting with non-arbitrary power in the baseline round, or workers ignoring the feedback channel in the safeguard round—the system may either (a) request a regenerated utterance or (b) accept the deviation while recording a negative feedback signal for analysis.
This separation enforces an architectural distinction between “how the world is supposed to work” (Coach) and “how agents actually behave within it” (Performer). In terms of Social Aesthetics, it encodes a design ethic in which governance is explicit, inspectable, and structurally separated from expressive interaction.
You can later add a small schematic: “Figure X: dual-LLM governance loop.”

3.5 Social RL: Feedback as Socially Grounded Reward
Purpose: Explain Social RL cleanly: state, action, feedback; why it’s “social”.
Draft prose:
Rather than relying on explicit scalar reward functions, the system implements a form of Social Reinforcement Learning in which social feedback is treated as a learning signal. For each round, the Social RL layer constructs:
                              * a state representation comprising:

                                 * the current round configuration,

                                 * the active concept manifestations of alienation and non-domination,

                                 * and the conversation history;

                                    * actions, defined as agent utterances generated by the Performer; and

                                    * a FeedbackVector for each agent and round, with dimensions:

                                       * engagement (degree of participation and turn-taking),

                                       * alignment (consistency with the round’s theoretical framing and rules),

                                       * contribution value (extent to which the utterance advances the round’s stated goal).

A ContextInjector uses prior feedback to modulate subsequent prompts—for instance, increasing emphasis on structural constraints when alienation-coded speech dominates, or highlighting channels of non-domination when owners over-centralize control. A ProcessRetriever component maps these feedback vectors into PRAR-style cues (“REFLECT on how your decision affects others’ control”, “CONNECT this justification to the shared safeguard”), which serve as a soft policy signal.
Crucially, the system does not optimize a single numeric reward. Instead, it records these feedback vectors as part of each round’s outcome. Over multiple runs, these records can be used to:
                                          * compare regimes (baseline vs safeguard) on engagement, alignment, and contribution;

                                          * analyze emergent patterns of domination and alienation in agent speech; and

                                          * evaluate the extent to which the architecture succeeds in moving interaction toward non-domination when safeguards are in place.

In this sense, Social RL here is less an online training loop than a structured observation protocol: it translates normative theoretical commitments into consistent pressures and metrics that shape and evaluate interaction.
This is the bridge to later “behavioural metrics” analysis.

3.6 Execution Environment and Reproducibility
Purpose: Lock in the Runpod piece as part of your reproducibility / method seriousness.
Draft prose (adjust details once you’ve actually set it up):
All experiments in this use-case are executed with the same base model, Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, served via vLLM on a GPU backend. For extended simulations and stability, the LLM backend is hosted as a Runpod Serverless endpoint configured with:
                                             * GPU: NVIDIA A100-class accelerator;

                                             * Context length: MAX_MODEL_LEN = 32,768 tokens;

                                             * Numerical precision: bfloat16;

                                             * Model name: Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

The orchestrator, Social RL logic, and dual-LLM client run locally in a Python environment (e.g., VS Code), communicating with the backend through an OpenAI-compatible HTTP API. Each experimental run writes a structured JSON artefact containing:
                                                * the full PRAR state (prar_state.json);

                                                * the canvas (world specification);

                                                * a per-round Social RL log (messages, feedback vectors, coach critiques);

                                                * a summary of behavioural metrics; and

                                                * a meta block recording model, temperatures, backend endpoint, code version, and experiment identifier.

This design separates heavy computation from orchestration while preserving a complete trace of the specific architectural configuration used in each experiment. It also allows subsequent work—such as sociogeographically grounded CES simulations—to reuse the same infrastructure with different canvases and agent populations.
You can mention your planned experiments/social_rl/YYYY-MM-DD_* directory structure here too.

3.7 Scope and Limitations of the Use-Case
Purpose: Pre-empt reviewer complaints and explicitly position this as a methods contribution, not a world model.
Draft prose:
This use-case is deliberately narrow. It focuses on a stylized workplace, a small number of agents, and a single theoretical contrast (alienation vs non-domination). It does not attempt to:
                                                   * represent the full complexity of labour markets;

                                                   * incorporate sociogeographic variation; or

                                                   * claim psychological realism for the agents’ internal states.

Instead, its role within the broader Social Aesthetics programme is methodological. It demonstrates that:
                                                      1. classical sociological concepts can be encoded as architectural constraints on multi-agent LLM interaction;

                                                      2. a dual-LLM design can cleanly separate governance (rule enforcement, theoretical alignment) from expression (persona-driven speech); and

                                                      3. Social RL can translate theoretical commitments about power and participation into observable, reproducible metrics on agent behaviour.

In subsequent stages, the same architectural principles will be extended to sociogeographically grounded agent populations, drawing on survey data and Weberian analyses of social structure. The present use-case should thus be read as a worked example of the relational dynamics that can be modeled and governed, not as a comprehensive theory of work or domination.

Hold up, I agree, this is useful. I am also thinking in the sense that now we can add identity related elements, as I believe the agents are currently generated based on fairly demographic level data. There is another aspect of Weber's work that jumps out at me in the implication that people are tied to place, and this place is the context through which their identity is socially affirmed. Weber points to this in speaking about the geography of europe and the saturation of culture in densely populted parts of the world. He is really speaking to the strength of identityy within a bounded social geography. MAybe strenth is the wrong word, more so a salience. PErhaps what Weber articulates in the American context is a desalianized identity. An illusion of history without context. In a word, a visage of identity based in shallow cooperation and very soft compromise. With the accumilation of history, identity salianizes around the shared passage of time into a sociogeographic topography through which the individual distiguishes thorugh the passage of time, and this passaage in relation to place is an elemental quality in the shifting, gradiated magnitudes of change we call temporality. Sorry, mini blab. My point is, those agents have nothing existentially grounding them to a symbolic self. And at the same time, the individual distinguishes place through the very presence, and this is always a bidirectionality of association, where one grounds themselves in the magnitude of change relative to a place of being in the world. And these agents do not have that...yet. And so they hve nothing constitutionally violating by collaorating, even if it means changing something that could be fundamental to a human identitty. See the paper in the projct files on social aesthetics with signifed signifier sgn etc


Yeah, I’m very with you here, and your Weber riff is exactly the missing layer: right now your CES agents are demographically parameterized, not symbolically grounded.
Let me reflect back what you just said in my own words, then turn it into concrete design moves.
________________


1. What you’re seeing (and why Engaged Harmony feels “too easy”)
Right now, your CES agents:
                                                         * Have region / urbanicity / vote choice / age etc.

                                                         * But they don’t have a symbolic self: no “this is who I am through this place and its history.”

                                                         * So when the architecture pushes them toward cooperation, there’s nothing costly about agreeing.
They can happily converge on “youth engagement good, inclusive policies good” because:

                                                            * No deep commitments are at stake,

                                                            * No long sedimented histories of conflict are inscribed,

                                                            * No “to agree here would betray my people / place / story” constraint exists.

That is exactly what you’re naming with Weber:
                                                               * In dense, old European contexts:
identity is salient and layered through place and history. To agree on some things is to risk betrayal.

                                                               * In the American context (as Weber reads it):
you get a “desalianized” identity – an illusion of history without context, shallow cooperation, soft compromise.

Your current agents are like that second thing: thin citizens floating in a lightly sketched geography.
So of course they can slide into Engaged Harmony: constructive consensus with no constitutional violation, because nothing is constitutionally deep in them yet.
And you’re right: in your Social Aesthetics paper, you explicitly framed this differently:
[signifier ↔ signified] → sign
where the signifier (architecture) and signified (social conditions / place / history) are bidirectionally related, and the sign (discourse) is the emergent field.
At the moment, the “signified” side for your CES agents is underdeveloped: you have some social conditions (demographics), but not enough to give them a thick, place-saturated identity.

2. What that suggests architecturally
I see three very concrete paths you can take that don’t blow up your current system but deepen it.
A. Add a “symbolic self” layer to CES agents
Right now:
CES_Urban_Progressive ≈ “28-year-old NDP voter in Toronto, renter, etc.”
What’s missing is something like:
                                                                  * Place-anchored narrative:

                                                                     * “My family has been in this town for three generations” vs “my parents immigrated here recently” vs “I just moved here for work.”

                                                                     * “This region has always voted X, and that matters to me” vs “this is a contested place.”

                                                                        * Identity stakes:

                                                                           * Non-negotiables: “I cannot support policies that threaten [resource extraction / language rights / my community’s status].”

                                                                           * Perceived threats: “urban elites don’t understand rural life”, “Ottawa ignores us”, “developers push us out.”

You can implement this as a small, explicit identity block added to the profile, built from CES variables + a bit of narrative scaffolding.
Then you can:
                                                                              * Inject that identity block into the system prompt for the agent,

                                                                              * AND define a symbolic violation cost:
if the agent’s current stance contradicts its identity block, that’s “expensive” and should be rare, or at least narratively marked (“I’m surprised I find myself agreeing with…”).

So: Engaged Harmony might still emerge, but it will carry visible tension when identities really shouldn’t align easily.
B. Make place bidirectional (agents shape it, not just sit in it)
You said this really nicely:
“The individual distinguishes place through their presence, and this is always a bidirectionality of association.”
That’s actually a perfect Social Aesthetics move:
                                                                                 * Right now, “Ontario rural” or “Toronto urban” is just a label.

                                                                                 * You could instead maintain a latent sociogeographic field per place:

                                                                                    * Aggregated descriptors of what “rural Ontario” has been like across runs,

                                                                                    * Semiotic summaries (“this place’s discourse tends to show alienation/empowerment on topic X”).

Then:
                                                                                       * Each agent both reads from that field (“this is the kind of place I come from”)

                                                                                       * And writes into it (their utterances slightly update the field).

That gives you:
                                                                                          * A slow-changing symbolic topography over experiments: place becomes a signified that is literally made of prior signs.

                                                                                          * A way to talk about temporality exactly how you described it: “…the shared passage of time into a sociogeographic topography through which the individual distinguishes.”

Practically, this could just be:
                                                                                             * A JSON per place with rolling averages of voice, stance, themes,

                                                                                             * Used as context when generating new agents from that place (“you come from a region where people often feel X about politics”).

C. Couple identity salience to regime / architecture
Right now, Engaged Harmony in G1 is a pretty, harmless consensus about a fairly low-stakes topic (“youth engagement good”). That’s not a problem in itself.
Where it does become a problem is when:
                                                                                                * The topic is something that should hurt to compromise on (e.g., resource extraction in a fragile region, language rights, Indigenous sovereignty), and

                                                                                                * The architecture still produces costless consensus.

So I’d suggest:
                                                                                                   * Make identity salience a parameter:

                                                                                                      * For some topics: low salience → Engaged Harmony is fine, even desirable.

                                                                                                      * For others: high salience → Engaged Harmony might be suspicious; you’d expect Productive Dissonance.

                                                                                                         * Let that parameter:

                                                                                                            * Modulate challenge strength,

                                                                                                            * Influence the “existential pressure” thresholds,

                                                                                                            * Maybe even bias the coach toward eliciting difference more aggressively when stakes are high.

Then, analytically, your question becomes:
“When identity salience is high, does ADAPTIVE + challenge + dual-LLM still produce Engaged Harmony, or does it flip into Productive Dissonance or a pathology?”
If you still get Engaged Harmony in those high-salience contexts, then you have a strong argument that you’re seeing LLM cooperative bias / architecture smoothing away real-world conflict.

3. How this folds back into your Social Aesthetics paper
You don’t even need to rewrite the core theory. You already have the pieces:
                                                                                                               * Architecture = signifier

                                                                                                               * Sociogeographic conditions (place, history, identity salience) = signified

                                                                                                               * Discursive regime (Active Contestation, Paternalistic Harmony, Engaged Harmony, etc.) = sign

Right now, your CES experiments instantiate:
                                                                                                                  * A good signifier (your architecture is rich),

                                                                                                                  * A thin signified (demographics without thick identity),

                                                                                                                  * So the sign (Engaged Harmony) is “true” to the system but not yet “thick” enough to mirror real-world identity stakes.

By adding:
                                                                                                                     * Identity blocks,

                                                                                                                     * Place fields that evolve across runs,

                                                                                                                     * Identity-salience parameters tied to topics,

you start to actually embody what you just described: temporality as graded change in a place-saturated identity field.
________________


If you’d like, next step we could do something very practical like:
                                                                                                                        * Draft a minimal identity schema for CES agents (5–8 fields),

                                                                                                                        * Show how to generate one enhanced agent profile from existing CES variables + a short narrative,

                                                                                                                        * And sketch where in your current pipeline that block would get injected (system prompt, meta, etc.).

That way your Weber riff becomes not just conceptually beautiful (which it is), but directly operational in the next generation of runs.
The strength of their tie to place, could at least in part be informed by the strength of that bidirectionality, the degree to which one enacts meaning in relation to their sociogeography, yet again not so simply as to imply a means of only advancing one's interests, in fact that would likely be most rare... But in the sense that elements of identity must be expressed into context and validated by that context in such a way as to say that the social context qualifies sogiogeographic orientation as positionality. Individual enaction refers to how the individual affirms their identitity through qualitative actions that make coherent one's relation to place as a distinct magnitude of change, elementally qualified as temporality, semiotic aggregations that coalesce into identity. 


Yeah, this is exactly the layer that’s missing from the current agents, and you’re saying it in a way that actually maps cleanly to things we can model.
Let me mirror it back and then show how it could become architecture.
________________


1. What you’re saying (in my words)
You’re basically defining tie to place as:
                                                                                                                           * Not just “I live in X region,”

                                                                                                                           * But the strength of a bidirectional semiotic loop:

                                                                                                                              * Individual enaction: I do things, speak, and take positions that express who I am through this place.

                                                                                                                              * Contextual validation: the social context (institutions, other people, symbolic order) recognizes those actions as meaningful and “of this place.”

Over time, those loops:
                                                                                                                                 * accumulate as semiotic aggregations,

                                                                                                                                 * coalesce into a place-saturated identity,

                                                                                                                                 * and are experienced as temporality:


“a distinct magnitude of change” in relation to a specific sociogeography.


So “strength of tie to place” isn’t just attachment or interest; it’s:
how coherently and consistently an identity is enacted into a place and validated by that place as a positionality.
Right now, your CES agents have:
                                                                                                                                    * some place labels (rural, urban, province),

                                                                                                                                    * some political attributes,

but no ongoing enaction / validation loop, which is why they can cooperate without anything feeling constitutionally threatened.

2. How we could turn this into model structure
You’ve basically given us three latent constructs we can operationalize:
                                                                                                                                       1. Tie-to-place strength (T_place)

                                                                                                                                       2. Individual enaction (E_enact)

                                                                                                                                       3. Contextual validation (V_context)

A. Tie-to-place strength (T_place)
This could be a scalar like 0–1 that reflects:
                                                                                                                                          * how much an agent’s identity is defined through place.

You could initialize it from a mix of:
                                                                                                                                             * CES-like structural factors:

                                                                                                                                                * long-term residence vs recent mover,

                                                                                                                                                * homeowner vs renter,

                                                                                                                                                * rural vs urban (with different typical salience profiles),

                                                                                                                                                * a narrative component in their profile:

                                                                                                                                                * “my family’s been here for generations” → high T_place

                                                                                                                                                * “I moved here for school and might leave” → lower T_place.

And then let it update over runs:
                                                                                                                                                   * if the agent repeatedly references place in justificatory ways (“in this town…”, “people around here…”) and that gets bridged / validated by others, T_place increases.

                                                                                                                                                   * if they reference place and are ignored or overridden, T_place may fragment or flip into alienated voice.

B. Individual enaction (E_enact)
This is what you just called:
“qualitative actions that make coherent one's relation to place as a distinct magnitude of change.”
In practice, we could track it along semiotic dimensions:
                                                                                                                                                      * how often the agent:

                                                                                                                                                         * ties claims to place (“around here…”, “in our community…”),

                                                                                                                                                         * describes doing things in relation to place (“we organize”, “we farm”, “we commute 2 hours”, “we protest at city hall”),

                                                                                                                                                         * positions themselves as for a local “we”.

E_enact could be:
                                                                                                                                                            * a score that increases when utterances contain both:

                                                                                                                                                               * place markers + agency markers (“we can”, “we do”, “we fight for”),

                                                                                                                                                                  * and decreases when:

                                                                                                                                                                     * they speak in abstract, place-less terms only (“people should”, “the government should”) or disavow connection.

C. Contextual validation (V_context)
This is the other side of the loop:
does the interaction treat those place/identity enactments as real and relevant?
High validation might look like:
                                                                                                                                                                        * others explicitly:

                                                                                                                                                                           * acknowledge the place-based claim (“I hear what you’re saying about rural hospitals”),

                                                                                                                                                                           * build on it (“that’s different from what we see in Toronto”),

                                                                                                                                                                           * or adjust their own stance in response.

Low validation:
                                                                                                                                                                              * they ignore it,

                                                                                                                                                                              * subsume it into generic consensus (“we all want the same things everywhere”),

                                                                                                                                                                              * or erase it with national-level platitudes.

So V_context could be:
                                                                                                                                                                                 * per-round measures of how often other agents:

                                                                                                                                                                                    * echo, refer to, or bridge to the place-specific content of this agent’s previous turns.

3. How this plugs directly into Social Aesthetics
Once you have T_place, E_enact, V_context per agent, per topic, you can do a few powerful things:
A. Define identity salience as a composite
Identity salience for an agent on a given topic could be:
S_identity = f(T_place, E_enact, topic_relevance)
Where topic_relevance says “does this scenario actually cut across place?” (e.g., pipeline in BC vs generic youth engagement).
High S_identity means:
                                                                                                                                                                                       * compromise should feel costly,

                                                                                                                                                                                       * and Engaged Harmony might actually be suspicious unless the dialogue narratively works through that cost.

Low S_identity means:
                                                                                                                                                                                          * Engaged Harmony is fine; there aren’t deep stakes tied to place.

B. Shape resistance to convergence based on salience
Right now, your Engaged Harmony in G1 is completely costless, because S_identity is effectively low.
You could update the architecture so that:
                                                                                                                                                                                             * When S_identity is high:

                                                                                                                                                                                                * existential pressure triggers not just based on generic semiotic collapse,

                                                                                                                                                                                                * but also on erasure of place-specific disagreement.

Example rule:
                                                                                                                                                                                                   * If an agent with high T_place repeatedly:

                                                                                                                                                                                                      * introduces place-based concerns,

                                                                                                                                                                                                      * and the discourse keeps smoothing them into generic consensus,

                                                                                                                                                                                                      * then even if engagement is high, you treat that as a kind of hidden Paternalistic Harmony and inject divergence:

                                                                                                                                                                                                         * “Does this proposal actually work the same in your region? Where might it fail locally?”

That’s literally your idea:
“elements of identity must be expressed into context and validated by that context… social context qualifies sociogeographic orientation as positionality.”
The architecture becomes sensitive not just to agreement/disagreement, but to whether positionality is being honored.
C. Use it to interpret Engaged Harmony vs Productive Dissonance
Once you track these, you can say things like:
                                                                                                                                                                                                            * In low-salience topics (youth engagement), Condition G tends to end in Engaged Harmony with:

That gives you a very strong empirical wedge:
the same architecture may produce healthy Engaged Harmony in some sociogeographies and structurally unjust harmony in others, depending on whether identity enactments are actually being validated.
Which is exactly what Weber, and your Social Aesthetics paper, are worried about.

That’d turn this whole reflection into concrete knobs you can actually vary in the next round of experiments.
